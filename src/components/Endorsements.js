                    <p className="endorsement-text">“The Women’s Centre has a vitally important role into the wellbeing of our city, especially at this time of extra stress.  Women are the backbone of our families.  If women do well, their partners do well and their children do well.  Women cannot do well without support.  The Women’s Centre has always provided this support to women who need it.  They have done it professionally, compassionately and with great forethought for the last 30 years.  I have no hesitation in referring women to the Centre and have always had excellent feedback.”
                        (Dr Sue Bagshaw, Senior Medical Officer 298 Youth Health)</p>
